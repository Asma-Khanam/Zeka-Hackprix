# 🧠 NEUROSENSE – Brain-Controlled Prosthetic System

**NEUROSENSE** is an advanced Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system designed to help individuals with limb loss control a prosthetic arm using only their brainwaves. Using a 64-channel EEG dataset and cloud-based processing, this project accurately interprets motor imagery signals in real-time. Unlike traditional setups that rely on devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano, Zeka-Hackprix leverages powerful cloud platforms for faster computation, greater accuracy, and improved scalability—making brain-controlled prosthetics more practical, accessible, and affordable.

> 💡 According to WHO, over **3 million people in India** live with limb amputations. Zeka-Hackprix is our step toward giving them intuitive, thought-controlled mobility.
